		<h1>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</h1>
		<p>
		In the age of knowledge, information, and data, the industrial sector is becoming very demanding for both the production of the technologies and the manpower to utilize these technologies.
The Faculty of Information Technology at the University of Petra addressed this demand and therefore established a program specially designed for that purpose, "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence" (DS&AI). Data Science and Artificial intelligence program focuses on the theoretical knowledge that is necessary for the students, and the practical side that is imperative to crystallize the theoretical knowledge. Therefore, the program was engineered by experts in the DS&AI so that our graduate will be equipped with a combination of theories and practices of Data Sciences and Artificial Intelligence.
