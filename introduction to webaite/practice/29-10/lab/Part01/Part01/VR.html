		<h1>Virtual and Augmented Reality</h1>
		<p>
		The field of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) is concerned with creating interactive computer environments either augmented on the real world or totally immersive digital environment, as well as, creating intelligent simulations using sophisticated and intelligent IT technology. This has made it a promising area for building virtual environments for many applications and services that can improve the quality of individuals’ lives and businesses and institutions through the integration of environments into several industries such as: healthcare, tourism, advertising, entertainment, construction, gaming, education, and space industries.

		As a result of the rapid development of Virtual and Augmented Reality, and the expected needs of the local and regional market for professionals in this area, the Faculty of Information Technology at University of Petra has introduced this program to provide the technical market with graduates holding the bachelor's degree who are able to design and develop VR/AR environments, and skilled in computer programming, and tools and applications of virtual and augmented reality.

The study plan took into account the balance between the theoretical side and the practical side, which is supported by specialized modern laboratories.
